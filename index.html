            <p>
                Lotteries are a form of gambling that involves the drawing of numbers for a prize. They are run by governments and private organizations around the world. The funds raised from lotteries are often used to support public services such as education, infrastructure, and healthcare.

            <details>
                <summary>How are the numbers generated?</summary>
                <p>Our system uses a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm to ensure that the numbers are as random as possible. Each number is selected independently and has an equal chance of being chosen.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Does this tool improve my chances of winning?</summary>
                <p>No, this tool is for entertainment purposes only. The lottery is a game of chance, and the odds of winning are the same for every number combination. Using this generator does not increase your statistical probability of winning.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>What are the most common lottery numbers?</summary>
                <p>Statistically, over a long period, all numbers should be drawn roughly the same number of times. However, in the short term, some numbers may appear more frequently than others. This is purely due to statistical variance and does not indicate that these numbers are more likely to be drawn in the future.</p>
