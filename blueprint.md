# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that generates random lottery numbers. It is built using modern web standards, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## Styles, Design, and Features

*   **Web Components:** The application uses a `lotto-generator` web component to encapsulate the functionality and styling of the lottery number generator.
*   **Modern CSS:** The UI is styled with modern CSS features, including CSS variables for theming, `box-shadow` for depth, and a responsive layout that works on different screen sizes.
*   **JavaScript:** The core logic for generating the random numbers is written in JavaScript, utilizing ES Modules and modern syntax.
*   **Visual Design:** The design is clean and intuitive, with a bold color scheme, clear typography, and a user-friendly interface.
*   **Bonus Number:** The generator now includes a bonus number.
*   **Color-Coded Numbers:** The lottery numbers are color-coded based on their value, similar to real lottery drawings.
